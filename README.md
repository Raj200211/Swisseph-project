Installation
1.	Ensure Python is Installed: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from python.org.
2.	Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Depending on your operating system, open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3.	Install pyswisseph: Use the pip command to install the pyswisseph package. Run the following command: 
   
This command will download and install pyswisseph along with any necessary dependencies.
4.	Verify Installation: After installation, you can verify that pyswisseph is installed correctly by writing this code.  
 
5.	Set the Ephemeris Path in Your Python Script: Use the set_ephe_path function from the swisseph library to specify the path to the directory where the ephemeris files are stored. Here is an example:
            
Make sure that the directory contains the ephemeris files. If you donâ€™t have then you can download them from the Swiss Ephemeris FTP site or git.
Replace '/path/to/your/ephemeris/directory' with the actual path to your ephemeris directory.
Example Code
Once pyswisseph is installed, you can use it to perform celestial calculations. Below is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate and print the positions of the Sun and Moon for a specific date and time using the swisseph library.
         
Explanation of Example Code
1.	Importing the Package: Import pyswisseph as swe to access the functionalities provided by the package and interact with the swisseph library.  
2.	Setting the Date: Define the year, month, day, and hour for which you want to calculate the planetary positions. In this example, the date is July 15, 2023, at 12:00 UTC.  
3.	Calculating Julian Day Number: Use swe.julday to convert the given date and time to Julian Day Number (JDN), which is used for astronomical calculations.  
4.	Defining Flags: Set the flags for the calculation. In this example, swe.FLG_SWIEPH and swe.FLG_SPEED are used, which are default flags for basic calculations.  
5.	Calculating Positions: Use swe.calc_ut to retrieve the positions of the Sun and Moon for the given Julian Day Number. The positions are returned in a tuple containing longitude, latitude, and distance.  
6.	Printing Results: Print the calculated positions of the Sun and Moon to the console. 
7.	Output  It may be different with time and position.
